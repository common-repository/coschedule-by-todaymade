== Frequently Asked Questions ==

##### How does the CoSchedule plug-in work?
CoSchedule synchronizes your WordPress posts, author, and category information to its servers, but all of your WordPress data remains in WordPress. CoSchedule will update that WordPress data as you direct, but the data always remains in WordPress. Social messages, tasks, comments, team members, and other data you create in CoSchedule will be stored on CoSchedule’s servers, and never in WordPress.

##### How do I connect my CoSchedule Account and my WordPress?
After you sign into your CoSchedule account, you can connect your WordPress blog to your account by following the directions in the Installation tab at the top of the page. If there is an issue with your CoSchedule account please reach out to support at support@coschedule.com.
